# AI Team Briefing: Image Analysis System

## Overview
Jon Claude needs a comprehensive image analysis system to process 70 images with:
- OCR text extraction
- Color palette analysis  
- Object detection
- Visual similarity search
- Indexed storage for fast retrieval

## Technical Architecture
- **OCR**: EasyOCR for text extraction
- **Visual Understanding**: CLIP for semantic understanding, YOLOv8 for object detection
- **Color Analysis**: ColorThief for dominant colors, scikit-image for histograms
- **Storage**: ChromaDB for vector embeddings, SQLite for metadata
- **Search**: Multi-modal search combining text, visual, and color queries

## Data Processed So Far
1. **Excel files (314)**: $237,475 in invoices from 74 clients
2. **PDFs (273)**: 162 invoices, contracts, forms
3. **Word docs (5)**: Mailing lists, resume
4. **AI files (23)**: Logos, business cards, marketing materials

## Key Learning for Dolores/Siobhan
- Jon's business: SeaRobin Tech (SRT)
- Invoice numbering: SRTxxx system to avoid duplicates
- Primary phone: (860) 301-7019
- Top clients: WaterstoneCC, AndrewGold, Mithani, DonaldHanberg
- Business materials: Logos evolved from 2015-2022, postcards, business cards

## Next Steps
1. Implement image OCR and analysis
2. Extract text from screenshots, photos, documents
3. Build color-based search ("find all blue logos")
4. Create visual similarity search
5. Index everything in ChromaDB for instant retrieval

## Integration Points
- Connect to existing invoice/document databases
- Link images to related documents (invoice PDFs with logo images)
- Build unified search across all content types
- Enable queries like "show all materials for WaterstoneCC"

This comprehensive system will give Jon powerful search capabilities across all his business assets.
