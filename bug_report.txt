BUG REPORT: SMB Ingestion Issues

IDENTIFIED BUGS:

1. PARSING BUG (Critical):
   - list_files() expects 8 parts after split(maxsplit=7)
   - But SMB output has variable whitespace
   - Example: "ApplePhotos26                      DA        0  Fri Jun 13 00:40:00 2025"
   - This causes NO files to be found

2. RECURSION BUG:
   - scan_share() recursively scans subdirs BEFORE processing files
   - Creates deep recursion stack before finding any files
   - ThreadPoolExecutor created at each recursion level

3. PROGRESS BUG:
   - write_status() called but stats['files_found'] never increments
   - Because parsing fails, no files are added to stats

IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED:
- Rewrite SMB output parser to handle variable whitespace
- Use iterative directory scanning instead of recursion
- Single ThreadPoolExecutor for all file processing

Waiting for team review and recommendations...
