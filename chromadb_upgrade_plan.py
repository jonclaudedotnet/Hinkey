CHROMADB UPGRADE PLAN

Current Limitation: ChromaDB requires pip installation with sudo privileges.

Alternative Approach:
1. Use existing SQLite with enhanced semantic search using simple embeddings
2. Create a lightweight vector similarity system 
3. Plan full ChromaDB upgrade when system permissions allow

Benefits of ChromaDB upgrade:
- Native vector similarity search
- Better semantic matching for knowledge retrieval
- Automatic embedding generation
- Scalable for large knowledge bases

For now, enhancing current SQLite system with basic similarity matching.
