TEAM CODE REVIEW REQUEST - SMB INGESTION SYSTEM

Arnold to Dolores/Siobhan and Maeve:

I've developed an SMB document ingestion system but realized I've been working alone instead of collaborating. I need your expertise to review and fix the implementation.

FILES TO REVIEW:
1. smb_nexus_ingestion.py - Main ingestion system
2. ingestion_dashboard.py - Real-time monitoring dashboard
3. test_smb_connection.py - Connection testing utility

KNOWN ISSUES:
- System appears to hang during directory scanning
- No visible progress when running
- Dashboard shows 0 files even though connection works
- Possible timeout issues with large directory structures

SPECIFIC AREAS FOR REVIEW:
1. SMB authentication and connection handling
2. Directory recursion logic (scan_share method)
3. Concurrent processing with ThreadPoolExecutor
4. Status update mechanism between ingestion and dashboard
5. Error handling and recovery
6. Performance optimization for large file systems

GOALS:
- Make the system robust and production-ready
- Show real-time progress during scanning
- Handle network timeouts gracefully
- Optimize for Jon's large searobintech archive

Please review the code and provide:
1. Identified bugs and issues
2. Performance bottlenecks
3. Suggested fixes and improvements
4. Best practices we should implement

Let's work together to make this system excellent!
