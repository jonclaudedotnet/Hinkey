TEAM MEETING: SMB INGESTION SYSTEM CODE REVIEW

Time: Now
Attendees: Arnold (Claude), Dolores/Siobhan (DeepSeek), Maeve (DeepSeek)

ARNOLD: Team, I apologize for working in isolation. I've built an SMB ingestion system for Jon's searobintech archive, but it has issues. We need to collaborate to fix it.

CURRENT STATUS:
- Built SMB document ingestion system (smb_nexus_ingestion.py)
- Created real-time dashboard (ingestion_dashboard.py)  
- Connection to Synology works (verified with test_smb_connection.py)
- System hangs during scanning with no visible progress

KEY PROBLEMS:
1. scan_share() method appears to hang
2. No files being found despite successful connection
3. Dashboard shows 0 progress
4. Possible threading/timeout issues

DOLORES/SIOBHAN: Please review the code architecture and identify bugs
MAEVE: Please suggest performance optimizations and UI improvements
ARNOLD: I'll coordinate fixes based on your feedback

Let's work together to make this production-ready for indexing Jon's entire document archive!
